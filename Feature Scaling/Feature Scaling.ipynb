    "- Feature scaling is the process of standardizing or normalizing the range of independent variables (features) in a dataset. \n",
    "- It is important in machine learning because many models are sensitive to the scale of the data, and scaling ensures that no feature dominates others due to differences in magnitude.\n",
    "- Feature Scaling does not change the nature of the data & its magnitude gets reduces and patern gets changes.\n",
    "- Scaling does not have any effect on outliers as their value just got compressed not removed "
